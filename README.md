# Notes:

- mongoose can slow down vscode's tsserver.js (high cpu, slow code autocomplete) (https://github.com/Automattic/mongoose/issues/10349)
- Not a good practice to upload config file anywhere but this project is for learning so :)
- run 'npm run watch:js' to create bundle files for pug
- net::ERR_BLOCKED_BY_CLIENT with ajax is caused by adblock
- mapbox and scripts not working caused by helmet's Content Security Policy
